# Learnings
`StoicismBot` is my first ever Discord Bot and it was fascinating experiencing how fulfilling it can be making Discord bots especially since I am a frequent user of Discord. Additionally, coding it with Dart which I've only been studying/using for less than a month has posed some roadblocks and difficulties for me along the way considering there are little to no bot creation tutorials, which made me scratch my head in the middle of the way. 

Regardless it's great that I was able to pull it off and I'm looking forward to releasing more features for the bot!

I was able to explore many things along the way, and the most notable ones are:
* Nyxx Library
* Dart
* API
* Discord API development
* http library
* **and so much more!**
